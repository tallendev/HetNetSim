\maketitle
This document serves to explain the assumptions and mathematical structure of the model being used in our HetNet Simulator in order to optimize it. It is based on the model used in \cite{amin13} but makes simplifying assumptions.

\section{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item The system is static-- optimizations are based only on the current state.
\item Devices have the ability to connect to all networks within range.
\item Devices can split traffic across networks in any configuration (they are not restricted to use one radio at a time, or even connect to one of each network type at a time).
\item Devices have no minimum bandwidth requirement; if they can be allocated any nonzero amount, they will be.
\item Devices also have no maximum bandwidth rate-- the network's rate is the bottleneck.
\item As distance from an access point increases, a device's maximum bandwidth rate decreases linearly.
\end{itemize}

\hline
$A$ & Set of Internet Access Points \\

$U$ & Set of Users \\

$d_{ua}$ & Distance between user $u \in U$ and the center of network $a \in A$ \\ 
\hline
$d_{ua,norm}$ & Normalized distance between user $u \in U$ and the center of network $a \in A$, calculated as $d_{ua}$ divided by the radius of the network $a$ \\ 
\hline
$n_a$ & Number of users $u \in U$ for whom $d_{ua,norm} \leq 1$\\ 
\hline
$r_{a,max}$ & Maximum potential rate of network $a \in A$ if it had one user whose $d_{ua} = 0$ \\ 
\hline
$r_{ua,max}$ & Maximum achievable rate by user $u \in U$ on network $a \in A$, calculated as $r_{a,max} * (1 - d_{ua,norm})$ whenever $d_{ua,norm} \leq 1$ or 0 otherwise. \\ 
\hline
$x_{ua}$ & Assignment variable. Detemines the percentage of $r_{ua,max}$ allocated to user $u \in U$ on network $a \in A$ with $0 \leq x_{ua} \leq 1$ \\ 
\hline
$r_{ua}$ & Calculated rate allocated to user $u \in U$ on network $a \in A$, equal to $x_{ua} * r_{ua,max}$ \\

$r_{ua,norm}$ & Normalized rate allocated to user $u \in U$ on network $a \in A$, calculated as $\displaystyle\frac{r_{ua}}{r_{ua,max}}$ \\[8pt]

$r_{u}$ & Total rate allocated to user $u \in U$, calculated as $\sum_{a \in A} r_{ua}$ \\

\subsection{Steps}
Solve the Linear Programming problem: \\ 
\indent \indent \indent \indent maximize:
$$\sum_{u \in U} r_u$$
\indent \indent \indent \indent subject to:
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\sum_{u \in U} r_{ua,norm} \leq 1 \ \ \forall a \in A
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
0 \leq x_{ua} \leq \frac{1}{n_a} \ \ \forall u \in U, \forall a \in A
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x_{ua} = 0 \text{ whenever } d_{ua,norm} > 1
\end{equation}

 Use the solution to calculate $r_{ua} \ \forall u \in U, \ \forall a \in A$ and represent these assignments visually.
Optionally, solve a similar problem with the upper bound on $x_{ua}$ being 1 instead of $\frac{1}{n_a}$, which would be a simple Max Sum Rates problem, to illustrate the difference.
