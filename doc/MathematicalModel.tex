\title{HetNet Simulator: Overview of Basic Mathematical Model}

\maketitle
This document serves to explain the assumptions and mathematical structure of the model being used in our HetNet Simulator in order to optimize it. It is based on the model used in \cite{amin13} but makes simplifying assumptions.
\section{Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item The system is static-- optimizations are based only on the current state.
\item Devices have the ability to connect to all networks within range.
\item Devices can split traffic across networks in any configuration (they are not restricted to use one radio at a time, or even connect to one of each network type at a time).
\item Devices have no minimum bandwidth requirement; if they can be allocated any nonzero amount, they will be.
\item Signals follow the free space propagation model, meaning a device's achievable data rate is \textit{approximately} the network's maximum data rate times the inverse square of the normalized distance between the device and the AP. 
\item Devices also have no maximum bandwidth rate-- the network's rate is the bottleneck.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve the Linear Programming problem:
 
\tab{maximize:}
$$\alpha * \sum_{u \in U} r_u + \beta * z$$
\tab{subject to:}
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\sum_{u \in U} r_{ua,norm} \leq 1 \ \ \forall a \in A
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
0 \leq x_{ua} \leq 1 \ \ \forall u \in U, \forall a \in A
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x_{ua} = 0 \text{ whenever } d_{ua,norm} > 1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
z \leq r_u \ \ \forall u \in U
\end{equation}

\item Use the solution to calculate $r_{ua} \ \forall u \in U, \ \forall a \in A$ and represent these assignments visually. 
\item Allow the user to adjust $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and observe the effects.
