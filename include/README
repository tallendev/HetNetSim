Note: During implementation we encounted some issues with templating. The .inl
files contain the implementation for any methods that required concrete 
implementations to be generated due to the template system. This files should 
probably be in SRC, but currently live here. If you are looking for a function
not defined in the src/.cpp file, it is probably here in an INL.
